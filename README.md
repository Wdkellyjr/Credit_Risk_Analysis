# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to help Fast Lending, a peer to peer lending service, use machine learning to predict credit risk. The companyâ€™s management team believes machine learning will provide a quicker and reliable loan experience. They also believe that the technology will lead to a more accurate identification of good candidates for loans which will lead to lower default rates. In this project, imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries were used to build models, which were then evaluated by using a resampling method. 

## Results

### Naive Random Oversampling

The analyzed data shows a balance accuracy score of 67.4% and recall of 61%.
